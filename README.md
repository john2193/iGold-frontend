### Pull Request Workflow

For every feature this is how you should work -

1. You are on master
2. `git pull`
3. `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
4. Make your changes
5. `git add -A`
6. `git commit -m "put in a commit message"`
7. The first time that you push a branch, you need to run `git push -u origin <branch_name>`
   For ALL OTHER TIMES, you just need to do `git push`
8. In Github, OPEN A NEW PULL REQUEST.
9. Get somebody (your team lead) to REVIEW THE CODE.
